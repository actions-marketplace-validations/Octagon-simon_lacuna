// models reliably fail to apply it even when told the exact pattern to use, re-emitting the same
// broken `jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(x)` verbatim across retries — so do it deterministically
// instead of relying on the model. Two shapes seen in practice:
//   jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(x)              -> (jest.fn() as unknown as jest.Mock<() => Promise<any>>).mockResolvedValue(x)
//   (thing as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(x)    -> (thing as unknown as jest.Mock<() => Promise<any>>).mockResolvedValue(x)
// A single-generic, full-function-type `jest.Mock<() => Promise<any>>` ONLY resolves this way
// under `@jest/globals`'s modern type (`Mock<T extends FunctionLike = UnknownFunction>`). Without
// `import { jest } from '@jest/globals'` in scope, the ambient (ships-with-@types/jest) `Mock` is
// the legacy 3-generic form (`Mock<T = any, Y extends any[] = any, C = any>`) where the first slot
// means RETURN TYPE, not a full function signature — so `Mock<() => Promise<any>>` silently binds
// `T` to a function type instead, and `.mockResolvedValue()`'s conditional overload (needs T to
// extend Promise) collapses to `never` again, the exact failure this function exists to fix.
// Confirmed by direct testing: this happens identically whether the annotation is written as a
// cast (`as unknown as jest.Mock<T>`), a call generic (`jest.fn<T>()`, which additionally hits a
// TS2743 arity error under the legacy ambient overloads), or a variable annotation — there is no
// generic-position trick that avoids it. So whenever this function performs a jest rewrite, it
// also ensures the file imports `{ jest }` from '@jest/globals' (merging into an existing import
// from that module if present) — vitest is left alone since `vi.fn<T>()`'s arity hasn't been
// observed to have the same fragility and vitest's `Mock<T>` is a different (args, return) shape
// that isn't safe to guess a fix for here. Already-generic forms (`jest.fn<...>()`,
// `as jest.Mock<...>`) don't match and are left alone.
